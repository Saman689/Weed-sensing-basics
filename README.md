# Weed-sensing-basics
Edith Cowan University weed sensing project
This repository includes the basics codes of Edith Cowan University weed sensing projects including reading data, making various networks, investigating designed (optimized) and pretrained networks, and testing on GPU machine and Jetson Board.

Two types of data were introduced and tested here, namely, spatial data and spectral data. Both data sets were collected simultaneously on a movable platform using different instruments for data capturing. Spatial data was captured using an On-Semi VITA 2000 camera and spectral data were collected by a specifically designed plant discrimination unit (PDU).
